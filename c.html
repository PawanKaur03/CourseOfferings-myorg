                <h2>Introduction to C Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    C programming language holds a central position in the world of programming, known for its efficiency and versatility.
                    Developed in the early 1970s, it serves as the foundation for many other programming languages and operating systems. C
                    is a procedural programming language, which means it follows a step-by-step approach to solving problems. Its syntax,
                    which includes functions, variables, and control structures, is widely used to create a wide range of applications from
                    small utility programs to complex system-level software.

                <h2>Basic Syntax and Data Types</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the basic syntax of C is fundamental to writing effective programs. C uses a semicolon to mark the end of
                    statements and curly braces to group blocks of code. It supports various data types such as integers, floating-point
                    numbers, characters, and arrays, providing flexibility in managing different types of data. Learning how to declare
                    variables and manipulate data types is essential for creating functional C programs.

                <h2>Control Structures and Decision Making</h2>
                <p>
                    Control structures in C enable programmers to dictate the flow of execution in a program. Concepts like if-else
                    statements, switch-case, and loops (for, while, do-while) play a pivotal role in making decisions and executing specific
                    parts of the code based on certain conditions. Mastering these control structures helps in creating programs with
                    dynamic behavior and efficient resource utilization.

                <h2>Functions and Modular Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Functions in C promote code reusability and modular programming. Programmers can break down complex tasks into smaller,
                    manageable functions, making the code more organized and easier to maintain. Understanding function declaration,
                    definition, and how to pass arguments to functions allows developers to build scalable and structured programs.

                <h2>Pointers and Memory Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Pointers are a unique feature of C that enables direct memory manipulation. They store memory addresses and provide
                    access to the underlying data, allowing programmers to implement advanced data structures and optimize memory usage.
                    Managing memory effectively is essential to avoid memory leaks and improve program performance.

                <h2>File Handling</h2>
                <p>
                    Working with files is a crucial aspect of many applications. C provides file handling functions that allow reading from
                    and writing to files, enabling programs to store and retrieve data persistently. Understanding file handling is vital
                    for applications that require data storage and retrieval, such as databases, text editors, and more.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid7 common-grid">
                <h2>Advanced Concepts and Libraries</h2>
                <p>
                    C also offers advanced concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, structures, and unions, which enhance the language's
                    capabilities. Moreover, C comes with a standard library that includes numerous built-in functions to perform various
                    tasks, such as string manipulation, mathematical computations, and input/output operations. Familiarity with these
                    advanced concepts and standard libraries expands the programmer's toolkit and helps in tackling complex challenges.
                    Mastering the fundamentals of C programming empowers developers to create efficient, scalable, and reliable software
                    solutions, making C an invaluable language in the world of programming.
